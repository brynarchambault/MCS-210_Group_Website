                <h2><u>History of Social Media</u></h2>
                <p> The history of social media starts with the emergence of the internet and personal computers in the 1970-80s, followed by blogging and online bulletin boards in the 90s.
                    The first social media platform, Six Degrees, was created in 1997. Friendster and LinkedIn were released in 2002 with different features.
                    MySpace and Facebook, 2003 and 2004 respectively, both became extremely popular among young adults. More recent social media platforms include Twitter (X), Instagram, and Snapchat.
                    Each social media platform varies in some way. This evolution will continue, especially since social media is relatively new. </p>

                <h2><u>Russia & Ukraine War</u></h2>
                <h3>What is the Current Conflict in Ukraine and Russia?</h3>
                <p> Tensions between Ukraine and Russia have been high for over a century, beginning roughly at the time of the 
                Russian Revolution in 1917. One major spark that helped ignite the current conflict between Urkaine and Russia
                began in 2014 when Russia formally annexed Crimea, a small peninsula connected to Ukraine in the Black Sea. 
                Further disputes and tensions between the two countries continues to escalate until coming to a head in February 24, 2022 
                when Russia invaded Ukraine. Russia's claims for invading Ukraine include "demilitariz[ing] and dinazify[ing] Ukraine 
                and end the alleged genocide of Russians in Ukraine territory." </p>

                <h3>What Role Does Social Media Have in Reporting on the Conflict?</h3>
                <p> Similar to journalism during the Holodomor, governments, namely Russia, have used to social media to limit the amount 
                of information that reaches its citizens. The Russian government has banned websites such as Facebook and X (formerly Twitter) 
                while heavily heavily censoring TikTok and YouTube. Throughout the conflict, Russian citizens have mainly relied on 
                sites like Vkontakte, Telegram, and Yandex for their news. All three sites are heavily monitered by the Russian government
                with "Posts on Vkontakte that mention the Ukraine war are immediately taken down and groups that deviate from the Kremlin's 
                message have been deleted." </p>
                <p>Those outside the countries involved are still at risk of consuming false information via social media. For example,
                "researchers found that TikTok directed users to false information about the war within 40 minutes of signing up. 
                New users on TikTok were shown videos claiming that... clips from a video game were real footage of the war." Also,
                with increased popularity of chatbots and deepfakes, citizens and governments can create false news events that could
                persuafe millions of people to believe one narrative of the war over another.</p>
