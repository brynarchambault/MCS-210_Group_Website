Our Goal
In this website, our goal is to analyze how social media
has impacted the way global conflicts are being documented.
In many ways, social media has allowed for previously unheard
voices to be heard by the entire world. However, social media
has also enabled entities to distort the truth and push
harmful agendas. Within this website, we also look at how 
global conflicts of the past have been reported (or in some cases
NOT reported) and the tactics that were used to either report
or distort the truth. When comparing documentation techniques,
it can be discerned that social media has become another way for
activists to reveal the truth, and for governments to 
cover it up.
