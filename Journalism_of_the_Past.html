                <h2><u>Journalism before Social Media</u></h2>
                <p>Before social media, primary news was spread and documented through a variety of formats.
                    First, information spread was communicated orally. Oral messages passed from generation to generation also preserved and documented events.
                    Then, information was dispersed and remembered through hand-writing. The invention of the printing press allowed for the rapid spread of information,
                    which created an industry for pamphlets and newspapers. This was followed by radios and television, which were more compelling to users due to the use of pictures and audio.
                    Television and radios also connected the world, which led to the development of foreign correspondents. However, we will briefly mention the problems
                    associated with each of these forms of communication. Oral messages left room for misinformation and bias. Hand-writing was time-consuming and slow to replicate.
                    Newspapers were limited to the previous day's news. Radios offered live updates, but that came with a risk of limited context for the information.
                    Televisions and films can distort information to gain public support and encourage morale, which is particularly popular in war-time.</p>
                <p>We will discuss the distortion of information in history further. For reference, fake news is defined as false stories that appear to be news,
                    spread on the internet or using other social media, usually created to influence political views or as a joke. Distorted news has been happening since
                    the invention of the printing press. Examples of fake news in history include the Catholic Church’s false explanation of the 1755 Lisbon Earthquake which was a catalyst of the Enlightenment,
                    published false stories about African American deficiencies and crimes in the US, and Nazi propaganda to spread anti-sematism. Fake news in its historical form
                    was created and spread by newspaper publishers. They often solely distorted the content by reporting rumors as facts and providing shocking headlines.
                    Ultimately, distortion of information was a way for newspapers to sell better and increase circulation, which creates a competitive advantage. Today, more people are
                    able to recognize obvious false stories and associate certain newspapers as false news sources, but that wasn’t true in the height of it.</p>

                <h2><u>The Holodomor</u></h2>
                <h3>What Was the Holodomor?</h3>
                <p>The Holodomor was a man-made famine turned genocide enacted by the Soviet Government in the early 1930s. 
                    Because of its high grain exports, Ukraine is commonly known as the "breadbasket" of Europe. In the early 1900s,
                    most of these grain farms were privately owned much to the dismay of the newly formed communist government. When Ukrainian
                    farmers opposed the collectivization of farms, the Soviet Government either executed private farm owners or shipped them
                    to concentration camps. They then raided villages and stripped all the households of food, either sending it back to Russia or 
                    putting it behind barbed-wire fences to rot in front of the starving villagers. Many villagers were forced to eat grass, pets, or 
                    in extreme cases, each other. By the end of the Holodomor in 1933, over 3.5 million Ukrainians perished, with some sources estimating
                    as many as 13 million died.</p>
                <h3>Journalism of the Holodomor and Potekim Villages</h3>
                <p>Since Ukraine was a part of the newly formed Soviet Union, the communist government
                    had the ability to greatly limit not only who was able to leave Ukraine, but who was able to enter.
                    When journalists both within and outside of the Soviet Union began to question reports of a supposed 
                    "famine" within Ukraine, the communist government created 'Potekim Villages' to divert suspicions.</p>
                <p> 'Potekim Villages' were villages throughout Ukraine that were staged to appear perfectly normal and
                    prosperous. The communist government would enter a village that was riddled with famine and starvation.
                    Instead of giving aid to those suffering, the government would forcibly remove the villagers to a seconday
                    location, often concentration camps. Then, after a throughout cleaning, the government would then install its
                    own healthy, well-fed members to pose as villagers. When journalists requested to see whether there was a famine with their own eyes,
                    government officials would bring them into these staged villages, expressing how any notions of a famine were
                    simply rumors. When these journalists left Ukraine convinced everything was perfectly normal, the government would
                    remove its members, along with any food they imported, and allowed the original villagers to return to their homes.</p>
                <p> Any Journalists the were unconvinced by the Potekim Villages were usually threatened by the Soviet Government. 
                    Many were threatened physically while others were threatened to have their visas restricted or to be journalistically blacklisted.</p>

                <a name="Nakba"></a> <!-- This is the anchor for the link to the Nakba section -->
                <h2><u>The Nakba</u></h2>
                <h3>What was the Nakba?</h3>
                <p>The Nakba, meaning "catastrophe" in Arabic, refers to the forced displacement of Palestinians during the 
                    1948 Arab-Israeli war. This included terrorism, massacres, and atrocities by Zionist militias and the 
                    Israeli military. Palestine, before the Nakba, was a thriving, multi-religious society with equal citizenship 
                    rights for Muslims, Christians, and Jews under Ottoman rule. The British Mandate period (1922-1948) favored 
                    Zionist political institutions, leading to growing tensions. The UN Partition Plan of 1947 proposed a Jewish 
                    state in 55% of Palestine, despite Jews constituting one-third of the population and owning 7% of the land. 
                    Palestinians rejected this as a violation of self-determination. They instead proposed a unitary, democratic state. 
                    Plan Dalet aimed at ethnic cleansing and began implementation before Israel's establishment. The ethnic 
                    cleansing intensified after Israel's creation, resulting in 750,000 Palestinian refugees by 1949. Even after 
                    armistice agreements, Israel continued to expel Palestinians. Today, there are over 7 million Palestinian refugees 
                    worldwide, and 400,000 Palestinian citizens of Israel are internally displaced persons.</p>
                <h3>Journalism and the Nakba</h3>
                <p>Within the 1948 borders, a media model promoting integration for the Palestinian minority was created. Newspapers 
                    such as al-Yawm portrayed Israel in a positive light. Even with more freedom after the end of the 1966 military 
                    government, there was still legal censorship and a restricted readership. In East Jerusalem and the West Bank, a 
                    Palestinian press emerged after the 1967 War, facing heavy restrictions. Al-Quds became a popular 'independent'
                    daily, but it operated under severe constraints with censorship. Israel targeted symbolic terms like kifāḥ (struggle) 
                    and ṣumūd (steadfastness). It suggested Israel aimed to suppress Palestinian heritage through censorship. 
                    The media's role in exposing the Nakba as a historical event is highlighted, particularly during the 50th 
                    anniversary in 1998, which marked the first mass Nakba commemoration. The newspapers provided historical overviews 
                    and showcased individual refugee stories to challenge the official Israeli narrative. The newspapers were 
                    important in acting as mobilization agents. Official political statements and calls for participation became 
                    important to Nakba anniversary issues. This source talks about the role of the media in keeping the Palestinian 
                    narrative of the Nakba and telling it to future generations, especially after the censorship and the mortality 
                    of first-generation Nakba eyewitnesses.</p>
